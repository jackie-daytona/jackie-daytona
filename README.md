## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Danny â€” welcome to my GitHub page! Youâ€™ll find a few projects here showcasing what Iâ€™ve learned while studying Computer Science at Oregon State. As Iâ€™ve improved as a programmer, some of my earlier work doesnâ€™t quite reflect where Iâ€™m at now, so Iâ€™m *finally* taking the time to revisit and improve a few of those projects (while adding a new one!) to better represent my current skills.

#### I'm currently working on...
* Revamping a "chess variant" final project from my Intro to CS II class to add full game functionality, a GUI, and cleaner logic
* A website for my father to upgrade his fantasy golf league from pen and paper to the information superhighway
    - Using Java, Spring Boot and Angular -- still designing this one!
* Courses in networks and parallel programming at OSU ðŸ¦«
